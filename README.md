The Island of Misfit Techies -

My motivation for this project was to have a simple yet curated feed with interesting posts regarding underrepresented peoples in technology. Inclusion and diversity in this industry is so imperative. We need ideas and talents from any and all demographics and walks of life to keep moving society forward. While my app isn’t quite a launchpad, it is a portal to keep up to date and learn more about inclusion in tech and get inspired. The posts section is just a quick and cute place to store/organize your thoughts without the pressure of share buttons.

I built this app using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
The CSS is custom.
